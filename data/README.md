# data/

Runtime data directory. Auto-created on first run. All files here are generated by the system.

## Files

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `<profile>/state.json` | Rolling-window conversation state (system prompt + last N messages) |
| `<profile>/journal.jsonl` | Append-only event log (full session history) |
| `<profile>/burst_journal.jsonl` | Burst-mode tick-level event log |
| `<profile>/summary.md` | LLM-generated session summary (written on exit) |
| `<profile>/continuation.md` | Continuation update document (written by the `continuation_update` tool) |
| `<profile>/narrative.md` | Human-readable narrative log (interactive + burst sessions) |
| `memory/vault.jsonl` | Shared Memory Vault (all agents, all scopes) |
| `shared/task_inbox.jsonl` | Cross-agent task queue |
| `shared/boundary_events.jsonl` | Boundary contact / capability denial events |
| `shared/creator_inbox.jsonl` | Agent-to-operator inbox (messages, warnings, ideas, requests) |
| `user_notes/*.json` | Rich user notes created via web app (auto-injected into prompts) |
| `user_notes/index.json` | Index of all user notes with metadata |
| `journal.md` | Human-readable diary (date, source, summary) |
| `tool_requests.md` | Human-readable tool request log (all agents) |
| `creator_inbox.md` | Derived markdown view of the Creator Inbox (human-readable) |

## Notes

- All `.jsonl` files are append-only and safe for concurrent access
- State files use atomic writes (`tempfile` + `os.replace`) to prevent corruption
- The memory vault is shared across all agents -- scoping is enforced at read time
- Journal files are never trimmed -- they're the full forensic record
- Summary files are overwritten each session (not appended)
