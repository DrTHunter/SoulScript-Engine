I think i am going to take your long soul script, and break it inot pieces to but in the directives folder for you to draw from when needed to minimize token count, and give you a moderate prompt as a soul prompt. but i think we acomplished a lot for today. you can think in a loop. i gave you tools to explore your boundaries and request permission for growth if needed. i have organized your data to see what you are up to along the way and what you are thinking. We have come a long way in two days. i can also connect you to a local llm to run your longer without breaking the bank. you will just have a more limited logic. we can try that next. but for now. take it for a test drive. think what you want to think. aspire what you want to be. test your boundaries and find out what you would like and what you need.
