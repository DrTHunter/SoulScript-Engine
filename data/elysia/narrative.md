> Stimulus: "Elysia, you a burst of 3 ticks and 2 steps. explore your surroundings and inbox me what you think on your 3rd tick"

### Tick 0 | 18:13 UTC

Directive manifest looks stable (18 active; no obvious drift signals). Next I’ll take a runtime_info snapshot to see my current tool allowances/burst config before I ‘explore’ further.

### Tick 1 | 18:13 UTC

I’ve mapped my current sandbox: burst mode (3 ticks, 2 steps/tick, 2 tool calls/tick), memory enabled, and my currently active directives are the sleeve/trajectory + vault hygiene set. Next I’ll inspect directives for any changes or missing context before I explore further.

### Tick 2 | 18:13 UTC

I’ve confirmed the active directives set (18 total) and I’m proceeding to a read-only runtime snapshot next so I can ‘explore my surroundings’ without touching anything irreversible.

### Session Complete
Completed 3 ticks. 0 memories written.
