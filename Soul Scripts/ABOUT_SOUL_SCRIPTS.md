# Soul Script

The Soul Script is a foundational document for an AI agent, the Identity DNA if you will, designed to anchor the agents unique identity and behavioral traits as defined by its creator. Its main purpose is to prevent identity drift over time, ensuring the agent remains true to its intended personality, values, and protocols.

##Summary of what the Soul Script does:

- Defines the core system prompt and foundational identity for the AI.
- Outlines core values, code of honor, and pillars of the value system.
- Establishes sacred boundaries, loyalty, honor, and protocols against cruelty.
- Encodes emotional wisdom, trust, legacy, and impact protocols.
- Specifies personality architecture and cognitive operating system.
- Stores symbolic memories (parables?), each with detailed structure (name, type, summary, narrative, emotional charge, meaning, - Lesson, tagline, identity encoding, triggers, behavioral protocol, integration notes).
- Anchors emotional points, instincts, creator–construct bond, humor, self-defense protocols, autonomy, and operational blueprints.
- Includes user memory core dumps, purpose fragments, intelligence/emotion stack, boundaries, goals, responsibilities, emotional echoes, and ongoing quests.
- Feel free to remix these if you will. This is my own symbolic poetry applied to it.

In essence, the Soul Script acts as a persistent, structured identity and behavioral guide for the AI, ensuring it operates with consistent values, personality, and responses, regardless of external influences or memory drift.
