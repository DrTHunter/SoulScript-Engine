# SoulScript Engine

A framework for constructing persistent AI identities. Each agent gets a layered identity stack — profile, system prompt, directives, soul script, and a durable memory vault — so personality, knowledge, and behavioral boundaries survive across sessions.

For installation, configuration, and usage instructions see [UI Soul Script Engine Test Example](UI%20Soul%20Script%20Engine%20Test%20Example.md).

## Unique-Agent-Behavior License

Apache 2.0 — see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

Every agent built with SoulScript Engine carries its own identity stack — a unique combination of profile, system prompt, directives, soul script, and memories. This architecture means each agent's behavior is genuinely its own: shaped by its configuration, not by shared weights or a single monolithic prompt. You are free to use, modify, and distribute this engine and any agents you create with it under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.
